# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the quality of wine using various machine learning algorithms based on physicochemical properties like acidity, alcohol, sugar, pH, and more. It aims to provide an objective and accurate alternative to traditional wine tasting using data-driven approaches.
